Everything grown and raised here is served at our restaurant and for sale in our marketplace. And considering it’s located less than 10KM from our store, this farm redefines ‘eating local’ at this scale. Controlling every step from seed to table helps us guarantee superior quality food that is free from chemicals and highly nutritious. <\/p><p>We practice regenerative farming, a conservation and rehabilitation approach to maintain biodiversity and earth’s natural order. All our produce is grown in soil which ensures the most delicious flavour and highest nutrient density. We strive to implement the latest techniques and technology in planting, harvesting and storage to keep us at the forefront of organic agriculture. <\/p><p>Tasti-Lee tomatoes, among other produce, is grown in our certified organic greenhouse. They are a natural-hybrid Florida-native, and Frank’s favourite, for good reason. These tomatoes have a low acid level, delicate skin, and exceptional taste and nutrition compared to average tomatoes. And Franks’ Organic Garden is the only location in Canada where these ready-to-eat tomatoes are available. Cucumbers, garlic, Yukon potatoes, fingerling potatoes, celeriac beets, kale, spinach, lettuce and more are grown in the greenhouse and on the farm. <\/p><p>The success of our farm rests on the shoulders of our team; people who care deeply about the environment, fine food, and the welfare of people, plants, and animals. As stewards of the land, they invest hours of physical and emotional resources to work in harmony with nature’s cycles. It’s challenging work and we’re grateful for their efforts. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["item_ePpdbg"],"settings":{"center_content":true,"preheading":"","heading":"","heading_font_size":3,"subheading":"","header_position":"above","item_heading_font":"heading","content_width":"custom","custom_width":1000,"color_scheme":"default","override_with_custom_colors":false,"override_color_text":"#393939","override_color_background":"#ffffff","section_style_spacing_top":36,"section_style_spacing_bottom":36,"section_style_enable_animation":true}},"image_hero_LT9JCF":{"type":"image-hero","blocks":{"heading_NHXcy3":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"Commissary","heading_font_size":6}},"text_GQAdWd":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>An OMAFRA-certified central kitchen where all of our Frank’s Signature items are created<\/p>","text_font_size":5}}},"block_order":["heading_NHXcy3","text_GQAdWd"],"settings":{"enable_full_width":false,"image_height_type":"custom","custom_height_desktop":"550px","custom_height_mobile":"450px","background_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/commissary.jpg","background_image_mobile":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/commissary.jpg","background_image_focal_point":"image_presentation","background_image_mobile_focal_point":"image_presentation","media_link":"","content_max_width":500,"text_position":"center_center","text_position_mobile":"center_center","image_overlay_tint_opacity":50,"image_overlay_tint_style":"solid","image_overlay_override_with_custom_colors":false,"image_overlay_override_color_text":"#ffffff","image_overlay_override_color_tint":"#000000","enable_text_box":false,"text_box_style":"soft_small","text_box_color_scheme":"default","text_box_override_with_custom_colors":false,"text_box_override_color_text":"#393939","text_box_override_color_background":"#ffffff","section_style_spacing_top":0,"section_style_spacing_bottom":0,"section_style_enable_animation":true}},"collapsible_row_list_f6AQKc":{"type":"collapsible-row-list","blocks":{"item_dxKDNV":{"type":"item","settings":{"expand_by_default":false,"icon":"none","title":"Read About Commissary","text":"<p>Our commissary is an OMAFRA-certified central kitchen.
