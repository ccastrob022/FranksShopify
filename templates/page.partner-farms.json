Frank discovered this truth when he personally visited their farm and Frank's Organic Garden is honoured to be an exclusive retailer. <\/p><p>Their farm operates with the rhythm of mother nature and keeps her at the forefront of everything they do. They do not use any synthetic chemicals to control pests on the farm such as weeds, bugs and disease. Consequently, they do not have to use genetically modified organisms (GMO) in cropping rotation. Everything fed to the soil and animals is organic and as nutrient dense as possible. <\/p><p>Cows, and other ruminant animals, are the corner stone of any regenerative farming system. GGF works with these animals increase photosynthesis and in essence turn sunlight and Carbon Dioxide into rich soil. The cow eats the grass and turns the plant matter back into manure which nourishes the soil, bringing life and growth back to the land.<\/p><p>Their herd is Heritage, English Breed Cattle, ranging from Hereford, Angus, Devon and Dexter. These British Breeds do very well on 100% forage diet, ie. no grain. All beef cattle have a lifespan of at least two years where they spend their time rotationally grazing through pasture, forest and annual cover crops. In the harsh winter season they house the herd in a naturally lit barn with outdoor access. <br\/><br\/>To keep our cattle healthy, they supplement sea salt and seaweed to bring essential minerals into their diet that are not found on the land. They also give them free choice apple cider vinegar to support their digestive system during harsh changes in weather.<\/p><p>Calving occurs within the months of May and June. This follows natural sequences and allows for the animals to be on pasture before they birth. <\/p><p>This considered, it is no surprise we believe their beef is the best available. Try any of our beef products today to experience this level of quality for yourself.<\/p><p><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["item_pd73jQ"],"settings":{"center_content":true,"preheading":"","heading":"","heading_font_size":3,"subheading":"","header_position":"above","item_heading_font":"heading","content_width":"custom","custom_width":1000,"color_scheme":"default","override_with_custom_colors":false,"override_color_text":"#393939","override_color_background":"#ffffff","section_style_spacing_top":36,"section_style_spacing_bottom":36,"section_style_enable_animation":true}},"image_hero_CgiCGQ":{"type":"image-hero","blocks":{"accent_zzrhcp":{"type":"accent","settings":{"text":"wallenstein, ontario","accent_font_size":5,"accent_divider_enable":true,"accent_divider_color":"accent"}},"heading_gAqa9a":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"3Gen Organics","heading_font_size":6}},"text_fiTjrJ":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Operated by the Israel family, their farm has been active for more than 5 generations.<\/p>","text_font_size":3}}},"block_order":["accent_zzrhcp","heading_gAqa9a","text_fiTjrJ"],"settings":{"enable_full_width":false,"image_height_type":"custom","custom_height_desktop":"350px","custom_height_mobile":"450px","background_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/organic-pork-new.jpg","background_image_mobile":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/organic-pork-new.jpg","background_image_focal_point":"image_presentation","background_image_mobile_focal_point":"image_presentation","media_link":"","content_max_width":500,"text_position":"center_center","text_position_mobile":"center_center","image_overlay_tint_opacity":20,"image_overlay_tint_style":"solid","image_overlay_override_with_custom_colors":false,"image_overlay_override_color_text":"#ffffff","image_overlay_override_color_tint":"#000000","enable_text_box":false,"text_box_style":"soft_small","text_box_color_scheme":"default","text_box_override_with_custom_colors":false,"text_box_override_color_text":"#393939","text_box_override_color_background":"#ffffff","section_style_spacing_top":0,"section_style_spacing_bottom":0,"section_style_enable_animation":true}},"collapsible_row_list_G8R7cb":{"type":"collapsible-row-list","blocks":{"item_diqVkh":{"type":"item","settings":{"expand_by_default":false,"icon":"none","title":"Learn More","text":"<p>Operated by the Israel family, their farm has been active for more than 5 generations.<\/p><p>Their organically raised pigs enjoy large housing, straw bedding, outdoor access, and an organic diet consisting entirely of corn, top growth (clover, brassica, radish), and hay which is all grown on their certified organic land.
